<p>With no lib32 packages available in KaOS and though there are good alternatives for communication it may not be enough for those who need to communicate with users of the Skype network with voice and video.<br />
You can have Skype on KaOS by emulating the app for android. Works great all functions. Below the steps needed get Skype on KaOS:</p>
<p>1. Install Google Chrome</p>
<p>2. Download and unzip the file 64-bit version of Archon Custom Runtime following the instructions on page below.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/vladikoff/chromeos-apk/blob/master/archon.md">https://github.com/vladikoff/chromeos-apk/blob/master/archon.md</a></p>
<p>3. In Google Chrome go to "Settings" and "Extensions".</p>
<p>4. Check the "Developer mode" box and "Load expanded extension"</p>
<p>5. Browse to till the unzipped folder Archon Custom Runtime.</p>
<p>6. Search, download and unzip the file skype on the site:<br />
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iIbxaftAu_ho5rv9fUlXSLTzwU6MbKOldsWXyrYiyo8/htmlview?usp=sharing&sle=true">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iIbxaftAu_ho5rv9fUlXSLTzwU6MbKOldsWXyrYiyo8/htmlview?usp=sharing&sle=true</a></p>
<p>7. Install as expanded extension in the same way as it did with Archon Custom Runtime.</p>
<p>8. Restart the browser, Skype will appear on the Google Chrome application tab!</p>
<p>Works well, including the icon in the notification area. In the same table where the skype, are available several android apps you may want to test.</p>
<p>Sorry my English, I'm better speaking Portuguese!  :)</p>
<p>have a fun!!</p>
