  Most of the infrastructure for KdeOS is up.  Server is setup with the repositories fully accessible.  All used projects are ported to github, which is also the bugtracker for now.  The framework for the website is done, this includes a fully functional forum and very complete online package database.
  Work is continuing to build the repo's from the ground up to an initial state of around 1500 packages.

<p>Most of the infrastructure for KaOS is up. Server is setup with the repositories fully accessible. All used projects are ported to github, which is also the bugtracker for now. The framework for the website is done, this includes a fully functional forum and very complete online package database.<br />
Work is continuing to build the repo's from the ground up to an initial state of around 1500 packages. Around 800 are done so far (only a few dozen are left in core).<br />
Basics are done for creating Live/Installation Media, next here will be to make a decision on which installer to use.<br />
Once all these parts are fully functional, a decision will have to be made whether to go public with KaOS, or keep it for private use only.</p>
