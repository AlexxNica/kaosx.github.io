<p>With the move of KDE 4.10.4 to the stable repo's, some two hundred more packages moved, with those, every package in every repository is build from scratch for KaOS. Starting with the gcc 4.8/glibc 2.17 based toolchain.<br />
The total amount of packages stands at a little over 1300 now. Once the language packs for just KDE, Calligra, LibreOffice and Firefox are added, that number will jump with 400-500, but the goal of about 1500 packages, does not include those.</p>
